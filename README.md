# Cross-Modal Co-Attention Mechanism Applied to Prognostic Modeling in Head and Neck Cancer

Cancer is one of the most important problems in current medicine and being able to make an accurate individualized prognosis for each patient is key in this complex disease, in order to be able to subsequently apply the appropriate treatment. Recent studies have develop Machine Learning and Deep Learning models capable of helping in making these decisions, providing sufficiently accurate and specific predictions for each patient. However, in order to make the right decision, many factors must be taken into account and the relationship between them. For this reason, this work presents a cross-modal deep learning architecture that models the relationship between different types of patient data through a co-attention mechanism, with the aim of extracting sufficient information to predict a 2-year overall survival. The results show that this architecture is able to successfully model the complex relationships between different data sources, thus helping the model to predict the desired output.
